      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the QuantsEdge website, products, and services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>QuantsEdge provides non-custodial, algorithmic trading infrastructure and related tools. We do not take custody of client assets and do not execute trades on a discretionary basis on behalf of clients. Any references to performance are for informational purposes only.</p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility and use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials and for activities occurring under your account.</li>
        <li>You agree not to misuse the Services, including by attempting unauthorized access, interfering with operation, or violating applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. No investment, legal, or tax advice</h2>
      <p>Information provided through the Services is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute investment, legal, accounting, or tax advice. You are solely responsible for your trading decisions and outcomes.</p>

      <h2>4. Non-custodial model</h2>
      <p>Our infrastructure is designed so that strategies can operate via user-controlled wallets or accounts you maintain at third-party providers. You remain responsible for safeguarding your private keys, wallets, API keys, and exchange accounts.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The Services may rely on or link to third-party platforms (e.g., exchanges, wallets, data providers). We are not responsible for the content, availability, security, or performance of third-party services, and your use of them may be governed by separate terms.</p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>The Services, including all software, models, content, logos, and branding, are owned by QuantsEdge or its licensors and are protected by applicable IP laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works except as expressly allowed in writing.</p>

      <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No reverse engineering, scraping, or load testing outside permitted usage.</li>
        <li>No use of the Services for unlawful activities, sanctions violations, or to harm others.</li>
        <li>No attempts to bypass security or rate limits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. QUANTSEDGE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.</p>

      <h2>9. Risk disclosure</h2>
      <p>Trading digital assets involves substantial risk, including market, liquidity, regulatory, technology, and cybersecurity risks. You can lose some or all of your capital. Past performance, hypothetical results, and backtests are not indicative of future results. See our <a href="risk.html" class="text-accent hover:underline">Risk Disclosure</a> for more details.</p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, QUANTSEDGE AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>

      <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless QuantsEdge and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to the Services or Terms</h2>
      <p>We may modify the Services or these Terms at any time. Material changes will be posted to this page with an updated date. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

      <h2>13. Governing law and venue</h2>
