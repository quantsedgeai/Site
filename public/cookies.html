      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: September 21, 2025</p>
      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how QuantsEdge Inc. ("QuantsEdge", "we", "us", or "our") uses
        cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit <a href="https://quantsedge.ai">quantsedge.ai</a>
        and any linked pages (collectively, the "Site").
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files placed on your device that gather and remember information about
        how you use a website. They help us run core site features, analyze performance, and tailor
        the experience to your preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strictly necessary cookies:</strong> Required for the Site to operate, including
          page navigation, security, and form submissions. These cookies cannot be switched off in
          our systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance cookies:</strong> Collect aggregated analytics about how visitors use the
          Site. This data lets us improve load times, page flows, and the content you interact with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> Remember choices you make, such as language settings or
          saved form details, to deliver a consistent experience between sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third party cookies:</strong> Some analytics and embedded services we rely on set their
          own cookies to measure usage or deliver content. These providers are listed in the section
          below.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Site may use third party analytics or infrastructure tools that place cookies in your
        browser. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and use data to supply
        aggregated metrics or deliver platform services to QuantsEdge. We currently evaluate any new
        tool for security, data minimization, and regional compliance before enabling it on the Site.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Manage Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        You can control cookie settings through your browser. Most browsers allow you to block or
        delete cookies, or to receive an alert before they are stored. The following links explain
        how to adjust settings in popular browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Chrome</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Safari</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Edge</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you disable cookies, some parts of the Site may not function properly or may lose certain
        personalized features.
      </p>

      <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
      <p>
        Some browsers include a Do Not Track ("DNT") signal. Because a consistent industry standard
        has not been adopted, QuantsEdge does not currently respond to DNT signals. We will update
        this policy if that changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify this Cookie Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the
        "Last updated" date above and, if the changes are material, provide additional notice through
        the Site or via email where appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
